Updating keyboard firmware
-------------------------------
1. install the Arduino ide
2. open vscode 
3. go extension search and install "platformio"
4. in the platformio home page click "open project"
5. find this folder
6. to upload program to the macro board, on the lower left should have a 
	right pointing arrow, press that after connecting the macro board


Reassigning macro key actions
-------------------------------
1. open the "KeyMaps.h" file in "src" folder
2. reassign what actions u want in there FOLLOWING THE FORMAT; 
	note: vscode should show suggestions on the special key when u type "KEY", if
			it doesn't press "ctrl + space"
	note: for non-special key (ascii keys), enclose it with single quotes, like shown in the file


NOTE: If my firmware not working, Nick's code is in the "ref" folder; replace everything in "src/main.cpp" with that
